# NER
Multilingual NER Transformer 
# A multilingual transformer that enables zero shot cross-lingual transfer
# suitable for 'code-switching' where a speaker may alternate between two or more languages
# fine tuned XLM-RoBERTa model to perform NER across several languages
# the dataset is a subset of the Cross-lingual Transfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark
# called WikiANN or PAN-X. It contains Wikipedia pages of many languages including four of the most
# common spoken in Switzerland (German 62.9%, French 22.9%, Italian 8.4%, and English 5.9%)
# each article is annotated with LOC (location), PER(person), and ORG (organisation) tags in the IOB2 format
